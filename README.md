Program takes an execution image, encrypt's data (packing at the same time) and clone's it, and finally append's a payload (a task) where the processor can't find it (unused data after last section's end).

# ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE

# Did 
- Code all program architecture (parse, elf64 functions, display)
- All elf64 (Execution and Linking Format 64bits) management
- Endian management

# TO DO
- Code an encrytor in ASM x64
- Code a decriptor in ASM x64
- Code payload i ASM x64
- Error mesages management
- Â·32 bits architecture

- And when all this will done: Recode all clean as fuck :)
